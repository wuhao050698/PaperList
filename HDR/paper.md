## Attention-guided Network for Ghost-free High Dynamic Range Imaging

### Main idea:
They propose an attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce high-quality ghost-free HDR images. The AHDRNet has two parts: the attention network is used to do the feature extraction. Attention can identify the misaligned components before merging the features for alleviating the ghosting artifacts. And the merging network is designed to do the HDR image estimation. They use the dilated residual dense blocks (DRDBs) and the global residual learning (GRL) strategy to estimates the HDR image.
### Highlight:
They use attention to guide the network to extract more feature to reduce artifact from misaligned.
### Idea:
They claim that their network with attention can solve the problem of large motion in this task. So whether attention is a good way to solve the large motion problem in video. And I can learn how they design the whole network to solve it.
